        <p>
          Pricing depends on the type of shoot, location, and duration. I offer
          packages that can be customized based on your needs. Let me know the
          details, and I can give you a quote.

        How long will it take to receive the photos?
      </button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
          Typically, I deliver the final photos within 2-4 weeks, depending on
          the complexity and the number of photos. I’ll keep you updated
          throughout the process.

        Do you provide retouching or editing?

      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
          Yes, all my photos are professionally edited. Basic retouching is
          included in the package, and more extensive edits can be requested for
          an additional fee.

        What should I wear for the shoot?

      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
          For portraits, solid colors or soft patterns work best. Avoid overly
          bright or distracting colors. If you're unsure, I can provide more
          specific recommendations based on the location or theme of the shoot.

          apply depending on the distance from my studio.

        <p>
          If the weather isn’t suitable, we can either reschedule or move to an
          indoor location. I’ll always work with you to make sure we get the
          best shots.

      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
          The number of photos varies depending on the package, but I typically
          provide between 20-50 final images for a standard session. You’ll get
          a mix of posed and candid shots.

        <p>
          Absolutely! Feel free to bring props that reflect your personality or
          style. I can guide you on how to incorporate them for the best
          results.

          Yes, I offer print packages in various sizes. You can choose from

          Life happens! Just let me know as soon as possible if you need to

          changes to avoid any fees.
